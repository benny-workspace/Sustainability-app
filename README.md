BTEC LVL 3 MAD GROUP PROJECT

Sustain IQ is an interactive app designed to educate users on sustainability through engaging content and quizzes. The app starts with a home screen displaying the logo. From there, users can click a button to navigate to the selection page, where they are given two options:

Gain Knowledge: In this section, users can watch an informative video about sustainability and have the option to go back to the selection page at any time.

Play Quiz: Users can challenge themselves with a sustainability-themed quiz to test their knowledge.

The app provides an easy and educational experience, encouraging users to both learn and actively participate in sustainability efforts.
