BTEC LVL 3 MAD GROUP PROJECT

Sustain IQ is an interactive app designed to educate users on sustainability through engaging content and quizzes. The app starts with a home screen displaying the logo. From there, users can click a button to navigate to the selection page, where they are given two options:

Gain Knowledge: In this section, users can watch an informative video about sustainability and have the option to go back to the selection page at any time.

Play Quiz: Users can challenge themselves with a sustainability-themed quiz to test their knowledge.

The app provides an easy and educational experience, encouraging users to both learn and actively participate in sustainability efforts.  got this from chatgpt....someone adjust this and give it
